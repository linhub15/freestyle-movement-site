    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in Freestyle Movement Breaking Program. The
      goal for this program is to introduce dancers to a unique set of
      foundation movements in Breaking. These movements will be taught step by
      step and chained together to form combos and sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dancer progresses, they will experience freestyling in a cypher
      circle where each dancer takes a turn expressing their interpretation of
      the music with the moves they have practiced. A cypher is where each
      dancer exchanges with the other dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those that feel comfortable, opportunities to compete in Breaking
      battles will come up throughout the year. Battles have been
      recently added as an
      <a href="https://olympics.com/en/sports/breaking/">olympic sport</a> and
      is judged unlike cyphering. Battling uses the same movements in
      Breaking but the purpose is to one-up (out do) your opponent through
      musicality, difficulty, and creativity all bundled together with overall
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a dancer you will definitely have fun learning breaking and get some
      good exercise while you're at it!
