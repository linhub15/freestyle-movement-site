# Code of Conduct

Freestyle Movement aims to facilitate a welcoming and inclusive community of breaking and freestyle dance in Edmonton.
Although dance battle culture is often seen as aggressive there is a time and place where it is appropriate.

"Keep it in the circle, keep it on the floor"

The whole story of Hiphop is about getting away from the lifestyle of crime and violence.
In the cyphers and in the battles we consent to participate knowing full well that egos will be bruised,
but battling is a no-contact activity and no touching is allowed.

"Earn respect by showing respect"

We agree that the following are unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated in the community.

- violence
- verbal, online and physical harassment
- repeated unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- discrimination
- illegal activity
- advocating for or encouraging the above

If you experience any of these behaviors please reach out to [Hubert Lin](mailto:hubert@freestylemovement.ca) or any of the community leaders.
We take these reports seriously, and will work through them on a case-by-case basis.
